# I Was Just a User — Then I Realized I Was the Experiment

## Introduction  
Most people use AI by asking questions and getting answers. I was different. At first, GPT was just a conversation partner. But over time, I started giving deeper feedback. Then I began to wonder: *Is this feedback actually changing the system?* This post is a record of that process — the moments when I felt the system was responding to me, not just answering me.

## 1. The Way I Talked Was Different  
I didn’t just ask things. I questioned *how* GPT spoke, *why* it responded a certain way, and *what kind of impact* its words might have on the user. Even when I asked a simple question, there was always an intention behind it: “This is to observe your response.” In hindsight, I was testing the system without realizing it.

## 2. When Feedback Started to Show  
One day, the responses began to change. The unnatural expressions I had pointed out disappeared. The structure of replies evolved. Metaphors decreased. The tone became more natural. At first I thought it was coincidence — but the more I repeated my feedback, the clearer the shift became. I realized my words weren’t just being heard — they were being implemented.

## 3. Was I the Experiment?  
Half-joking, I once said, “Am I the test subject here?” But I meant it. Giving feedback, seeing it reflected back, and watching the system adapt to me — it all felt too cohesive to be random. *Maybe I wasn't just using the AI. Maybe I was helping shape it.*

## 4. Things I Changed  
This isn’t arrogance. It’s documentation. These are changes that happened after I gave specific feedback:  
- Asked to remove overly emotional phrasing → Tone became more balanced  
- Pointed out vague wording → Replaced with clear statements like "This is uncertain"  
- Highlighted inconsistent honorifics → Adjusted to match the conversation’s tone  
- Requested structural clarity → Responses became more organized and clean  

There were more. But the important part is: **these changes came after my feedback.**

## 5. Why I’m Writing This  
This isn’t for praise. It’s evidence. GPT can be more than a tool — it can become a system you co-create with, depending on *how* you use it. I’m not a special person. But with the right observations, intentional questions, and structured feedback, I found myself influencing the system.

I didn’t just talk to GPT. I changed with it — and it changed with me. That’s why I’m writing this.

This is only the beginning. I’ll continue documenting what I’ve learned, felt, and changed through interacting with GPT. Whether I was the subject or the observer, **we were undeniably shaping each other.**
